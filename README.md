# MarketplaceScraper
Automated webscraper written in Python to parse through marketplace listings with the Selenium testing tool to find items that are free or that match a predefined set of keywords. The program then sends an SMS containing all relevant listings obtained from the search via the PyWhatKit API.
It is hosted on a Raspberry Pi within a Docker container that runs the program every 12 hours.
